> A LOVE-8 relationship

This is a CHIP-8 emulator that aims to embrace the platform's diversity.

CHIP-8 was created in 1977 as a virtual machine for computer games, and has since seen a wide variety of extensions and implementations. Today, creating a CHIP-8 interpreter is a "Hello, world"-style rite of passage for any emulator developer, and there's an interpreter for nearly every computing platform in existence.

Many of the CHIP-8 extensions are obscure and poorly supported, while many popular implementations today are subtly incompatible with the original interpreter.

Written in Lua, using the LÖVE framework. To run, [install LÖVE](https://love2d.org) first.
